One of the key features of this theme is comprehensive keyboard navigation, inspired by Emacs keybindings.

## Philosophy

Emacs users know the power of keeping your hands on the keyboard. This theme brings that same efficiency to your blog reading experience.

## Navigation Keys

### In the Article List

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` / `↓` | Move to next article |
| `p` / `↑` | Move to previous article |
| `RET` / `o` | Open selected article |
| `<` | Jump to first article |
| `>` | Jump to last article |

### In an Article

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` / `p` | Scroll or navigate (context-dependent) |
| `SPC` | Page down |
| `S-SPC` | Page up |
| `C-v` / `M-v` | Page down / up (Emacs style) |
| `<` / `>` | Beginning / end of article |
| `q` | Return to list |

## Tips

1. **Split view**: Use `C-x 3` to read articles while keeping the list visible
2. **Quick switching**: `Tab` or `C-x o` switches between windows
3. **Theme toggle**: Press `t` anytime to switch between dark and light modes
4. **Font size**: Use `+` and `-` to adjust text size
